What is Timato?

Timato is an automated scheduler that uses an optimization algorithm to automatically schedule your events as you add them into the app. It uses the Pomodoro technique for productivity with breaks (pomodoro (Italian tomato) + time = Timato). It includes periodic screen blockers to make you look away, preventing eyestrain.
